# Calculate-Internal-Rate-of-Investment

Python program that calculates the internal rate of return (IRR) of an investment. The IRR is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of an investment equal to zero. It is a measure of the profitability of an investment, and it is often used to compare the relative attractiveness of different investment opportunities.

This program uses a bisection method to iteratively narrow down the possible range of IRR values until the IRR is found with a high degree of accuracy.
